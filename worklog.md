## Current Project Status

### Assessment
The White Wolf Hosting platform is stable and fully functional with zero lint errors. All 14+ pages render correctly with RTL Arabic dark wolf theme. The dev server compiles successfully and all API routes respond correctly.

### Completed in This Phase
1. **Full QA testing** via agent-browser — all pages tested and verified
2. **Bug fix**: Fixed command-palette.tsx invalid `Escape` lucide-react import → replaced with `X`
3. **Pricing Plans section** added to landing page (3 tiers: Free/Pro/Enterprise)
4. **FAQ section** added to landing page (6 questions with accordion)
5. **Command Palette** (Ctrl+K) feature — keyboard-driven navigation
6. **Notification Dropdown** — bell icon popover with 5 mock notifications
7. **Help Center page** — documentation with search, quick start, knowledge base, articles
8. **Sidebar improvements** — section separator, help center nav item
9. **10 new CSS animation classes** added to globals.css

### Total Pages/Features
- Landing page (with pricing + FAQ)
- Login / Register
- Dashboard (stats, charts, activity)
- Bot list / Bot detail
- Bot templates (8 templates)
- Bot monitoring
- File manager
- Log viewer
- Activity center (notifications)
- Help center
- Settings
- Admin panel / User management
- Command palette (Ctrl+K)
- Notification dropdown

### Unresolved Issues & Risks
- Bot templates use mock data (no actual template files)
- Activity center uses mock notifications (no notification API)
- Bot monitoring uses simulated metrics (no Docker stats API)
- Command palette doesn't include help center in its nav items (can be added)

### Priority Recommendations for Next Phase
1. Add Help Center to command palette navigation items
2. Implement real notification system with database persistence
3. Add bot template API + actual template file storage
4. Integrate Docker stats API for real monitoring metrics
5. Add WebSocket for real-time log streaming
6. Add file upload with drag-and-drop in file manager
7. Add bot console/terminal feature
8. Add dark/light theme toggle
